Writers Interactive Narrative Group

Manifesto

I believe interactive literature is a fantastic medium, with the ability to let readers explore mysteries, take risks with their characters, solve puzzles, and make meaningful choices to a story they are following. 

One thing that has held the medium back in the digital age is a lack of mature tools for writing, testing, and releasing these interactive stories. 

However my recent experiences with the Ink language has made me enjoy writing interactive fiction, and excited me with the possibilities. Not only does it provide easy to use tools for writing and testing, but it somes with a huge array of libraries for delpoying to game engines, the web and hardware devices.

The goal of forming this group is to make a vessel of sorts, populated with a diverse range of creative people who would like to come on an expidition into unfamilair narrative territory. Using games, and experiements To explore the ink language, and the medium of interactive fiction, and to create a resource for other writers, and a place for readers to try a library of short interactive fiction.
